Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "([])"
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

Big O Notation solution:
The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string s.
This is because we traverse the string once, performing constant-time operations at each step.
Space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, if all characters are opening brackets.
